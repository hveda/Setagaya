package metrics

// Interval is one second of measurement from one engine pod, as bzt's
// aggregator reports it.
//
// It carries the response-time buckets rather than percentiles, because
// percentiles cannot be combined across pods afterwards. This is the payload a
// sidecar pushes to the control plane, so its json tags are a wire contract:
// the Python reporter inside the engine pod writes exactly this shape.
type Interval struct {
	// Seq orders this interval within its shard's stream, counting from one.
	//
	// It is what makes a duplicate recognisable. A sidecar clears its pending
	// intervals only once a push succeeds, so a push whose response was lost is
	// followed by a *superset* batch carrying those intervals again alongside new
	// ones -- and a batch boundary can fall between two labels of the same
	// second. Neither a batch identity nor a timestamp can separate what has been
	// absorbed from what has not; a per-interval sequence can.
	//
	// Assigned by the sidecar, not the Python reporter, so it is not part of the
	// contract with bzt.
	Seq int64 `json:"seq,omitempty"`
	// Timestamp is the second this interval covers, in Unix seconds.
	Timestamp int64 `json:"ts"`
	// Label is the request this measures. Honryu assigns labels when it compiles
	// a config, but engines do not all honour them -- JMeter echoes the
	// configured label while apiritif and k6 report the URL -- so a label seen
	// here may still need mapping back to the one Honryu chose.
	Label string `json:"label"`
	// Concurrency is the virtual users active in this pod during the interval.
	Concurrency int `json:"concurrency"`
	// Samples is how many requests completed in the interval.
	Samples int64 `json:"samples"`
	// Succeeded and Failed split Samples by outcome.
	Succeeded int64 `json:"succeeded"`
	Failed    int64 `json:"failed"`
	// Bytes received during the interval.
	Bytes int64 `json:"bytes"`
	// Latency holds the response-time buckets, in seconds.
	Latency Histogram `json:"latency"`
	// ResponseCodes counts each status the target returned. Codes are consistent
	// across engines where messages are not, so they are the reliable key for
	// grouping errors.
	ResponseCodes map[string]int64 `json:"response_codes,omitempty"`
	// Errors are the failures the engine saw, grouped as it grouped them.
	Errors []ErrorGroup `json:"errors,omitempty"`
}

// ErrorGroup is one failure mode within an interval.
type ErrorGroup struct {
	// Message is the engine's own wording. It differs between engines for the
	// same failure, so it is an exemplar for a human, never a grouping key.
	Message string `json:"message"`
	// ResponseCode is the status that produced the failure, where there was one.
	ResponseCode string `json:"response_code,omitempty"`
	Count        int64  `json:"count"`

// Batch is what a sidecar pushes in one request: the intervals it has collected,
// stamped with the pod that produced them.

	RunID       int64 `json:"run_id"`
	// ShardIndex identifies the pod within the execution, matching the shard
	// plan, so a duplicate push can be recognised as such.
	ShardIndex int `json:"shard_index"`
	// StreamID identifies the sidecar instance that produced these intervals.
	//
	// Interval sequences count from one per instance, so a pod that restarted
	// begins again at one. Without knowing the stream changed, a control plane
	// holding a high-water mark would take the restarted pod's measurements for
	// duplicates and discard the rest of the run.
	StreamID  string     `json:"stream_id,omitempty"`
	Intervals []Interval `json:"intervals"`
	// Final marks the last batch a pod will send, so the control plane knows the
	// pod finished rather than went silent.
	Final bool `json:"final,omitempty"`
	// ExitCode is bzt's process exit code, present once the engine has finished
	// on its own -- see taurus.OutcomeFromExitCode. Its absence on a final batch
	// means the pod was torn down before the engine could write it.
	ExitCode *int `json:"exit_code,omitempty"`
