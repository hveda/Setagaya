// ReportStore persists what a run produced.
//
// Reports are kept because they are the evidence a readiness judgement was made
// on. They must outlive the engines that produced them, the metrics backend's
// retention, and the campaign they belonged to -- so this is durable storage,
// not a query against a metrics system that will have forgotten.

	// SaveReport stores a run's report. A run has one outcome: the first report
	// saved for a run is the one that survives, and saving again for the same
	// run is a no-op rather than a replacement.
	//
	// This is what makes it safe for a run's natural completion and a
	// concurrent Honryu-initiated Stop/Purge to race to finalise the same run:
	// both may compute a report and both call SaveReport, but only the first to
	// actually persist wins, and the caller that lost can still discard its
	// working state unconditionally rather than needing to know which one it
	// was. A plain replace-on-conflict would let whichever call happened to
	// commit last silently overwrite the other's verdict.
