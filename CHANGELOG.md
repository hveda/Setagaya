# Changelog

## [Unreleased] — 奔流 (Honryu)

The project is renamed from Setagaya to **奔流 (Honryu)**, with `honryu` as the
technical slug. The GitHub repository and the Go module path move together —
`github.com/heridotlife/Setagaya` → `github.com/heridotlife/honryu` — so `go get`
breaks once rather than twice. Importers must update their import paths; GitHub
redirects the old repository URL, but Go module paths are not redirected.

**Vocabulary realigned to Taurus and the wider load-testing community.** The
old `plan` / `collection` terms forced users to translate on every interaction:

* `plan` → **scenario** — the reusable workload definition.
* `collection` → **execution** — the runnable unit that groups scenarios.
* the former `execution` config (concurrency, ramp-up, duration, engines) →
  **loadprofile**, whose `Entry` maps onto one Taurus execution block.

This runs through the domain, ports, use-cases, HTTP API (`/api/scenarios`,
`/api/executions`), JSON fields, object-store keys, RBAC resources, Kubernetes
labels, Prometheus metric and label names, and the Grafana dashboards.

* RBAC's previous `execution` resource (lifecycle actions: deploy, trigger,
  stop) is now `run`, since `execution` names the aggregate.
* Environment variables move from the `SETAGAYA_` prefix to `HONRYU_`.
* Prometheus metrics move from `setagaya_*` to `honryu_*`;
  `latency_collection` → `latency_execution` and `latency_plan` →
  `latency_scenario`; the `collection_id` / `plan_id` labels become
  `execution_id` / `scenario_id`. Bundled dashboards are updated to match.
* The database schema is restated as a fresh baseline in the new vocabulary.
  The previous migrations existed so v2 and v3 could share one database during a
  strangler cutover; Honryu migrates from Shibuya by importing JMX assets only,
  so there is no data to carry across.

**Breaking:** every API route, JSON field, environment variable, metric name,
object-store key, and table name changes. There is no compatibility shim.

Honryu requires an **empty database**. Migrations are tracked by filename, and
the baseline renamed all but one file, so pointing Honryu at a pre-rename
database would create the new tables empty alongside the old populated ones and
start up looking healthy but empty. `Migrate` now refuses such a database by
name rather than allowing that. Migrate from Shibuya by importing JMX assets
into a fresh database; uploaded artifacts must be re-uploaded, since the
object-store key prefixes changed with the vocabulary.

## [Unreleased] — v3 rewrite

Ground-up, test-driven rebuild on a hexagonal (ports-and-adapters) architecture,
promoted to the repository root. The legacy v2 codebase (`setagaya/`,
`ingress-controller/`, `local_storage/`) and its Kubernetes/Helm assets have
been removed.

* Pure domain, use-cases over ports, and thin adapters — each adapter validated
  by the same conformance suite as its in-memory fake.
* Repository (MySQL), scheduler (Kubernetes), executors (JMeter, k6), object
  storage (local filesystem, Sonatype Nexus), Prometheus metrics, SSE streaming,
  usage tracking, and admin/auto-purge.
* Pluggable authentication (no-auth, static token, OIDC), config-driven RBAC and
  multi-tenancy with tenant-scoped project access and an audit log.
* CI enforces a ≥90% coverage gate across unit, integration (testcontainers),
  and end-to-end tests.

  - Scheduled/manual scans: Use time-based scanning (7-day window) instead of diff-based approach
* **Dockerfile Linting**: Added `.hadolint.yaml` configuration to handle Alpine package versioning
  - Ignores DL3018 warnings (industry best practice for Alpine packages)
  - Uses SHA-pinned base images for security instead of package version pinning
  - Updated code-quality workflow to use the configuration file

#### 📚 Documentation Updates
