  title: Setagaya Load Testing Platform API
  description: |
    REST API for the Setagaya distributed load testing platform. Setagaya orchestrates Apache JMeter engines across Kubernetes clusters to provide scalable load testing capabilities.

    ## Architecture
    Setagaya follows a Project → Collection → Plan → ExecutionPlan hierarchy:
    - **Projects**: Top-level organizational units with ownership controls
    - **Collections**: Execution units containing multiple plans running simultaneously
    - **Plans**: Test configurations with JMeter test files
    - **ExecutionPlans**: Specify engines and concurrency per plan within collections

    ## Authentication
    The API supports LDAP authentication with project ownership validation. In local development mode, authentication can be disabled.

    ## Real-time Metrics
    Collections provide real-time metrics via Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live dashboard updates.
